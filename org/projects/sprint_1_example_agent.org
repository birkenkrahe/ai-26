* Sample Proposal (Single-Agent Example Only): Task List Maintenance Agent

** Problem Description

Many students and professionals maintain task lists for coursework, jobs,
and personal commitments, but the list quickly becomes inconsistent:
items are duplicated, priorities drift, deadlines are unclear, and tasks
accumulate without an obvious weekly plan.

The human workflow this project targets is the repeated process of:
1) capturing new tasks from email, class, meetings, or memory,
2) rewriting or reorganizing the list,
3) deciding what to do next, and
4) tracking what is done.

This is a good target for agentic assistance because it is frequent,
stateful, and rule-based (even if the rules are personal).

** Reason

This problem is interesting because it is universal and repeatable: the
same “update the list” work happens every day or every week. A well-made
assistant would reduce friction in staying organized and would make the
task list more reliable as a planning tool.

This is also a good beginner agent project because inputs can be kept
explicit and structured (simple text or a small table), and success is
easy to judge by inspection.

** Constraints

- Inputs may be incomplete (missing dates, vague task descriptions).
- Different tasks may use inconsistent wording for the same work.
- The agent cannot know true task duration or real priorities unless the
  user provides them.
- The project must remain a *single-agent* system: one coherent assistant
  that repeatedly reads inputs, updates state, and produces outputs.

To manage these constraints, the agent will:
- ask for missing required fields when needed (e.g., due date),
- avoid inventing details,
- maintain a transparent task table that the user can edit.

** Goals and Non-Goals

*** Goals (ordered by importance)

1. Maintain a task list as a structured state file (CSV or simple table)
   with fields such as:
   - task description
   - due date (optional but encouraged)
   - priority (optional)
   - status (todo / doing / done)
   - notes (optional)

2. Provide an updated task list after each “update cycle,” including:
   - newly added tasks
   - updated statuses
   - resolved duplicates (when confident) or flagged duplicates (when not)

3. Produce a short weekly view (e.g., “next 7 days”) that highlights:
   - tasks due soon
   - overdue tasks
   - tasks lacking due dates

*** Non-Goals

- Automatically sending reminders or notifications.
- Integrating with external calendar APIs or email systems.
- Estimating actual time-to-complete or making authoritative priority
  decisions.
- Autonomously creating tasks from sources without the user providing the
  text.

** Metrics

The project will be considered successful if:

- The agent produces a task table that remains consistent across updates
  (no silent overwriting or disappearing tasks).
- The user can update their task list faster than manual editing.
  (Example metric: reduce weekly task-list maintenance time by ~30–50%.)
- The weekly view correctly identifies:
  - tasks due within 7 days,
  - overdue tasks,
  - and tasks with missing due dates.

A simple evaluation plan:
- Run the agent weekly for at least two weeks on real tasks.
- Compare the time spent maintaining the task list with and without the
  agent.
- Check for errors: missing tasks, invented dates, incorrect status
  changes, or incorrect duplicate merges.

** References

- Documentation for the AI tool used (ChatGPT or equivalent).
- Any task-list format reference used (CSV conventions, GTD notes, or
  personal workflow notes).
- Personal communication (your own workflow observations) is acceptable
  as a source if clearly labeled.
