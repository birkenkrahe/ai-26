* Generative AI Deep-Dive Project Ideas (Option 2)

Each project focuses on *understanding, analysis, and explanation* rather
than building an agent. The final deliverable is expected to be a
structured written artifact (report, comparison, or analytical memo).

1. *How large language models generate text*  
   An exploration of tokens, probabilities, and sampling, explaining how
   models turn prompts into sequences of words and why outputs vary.

2. *Hallucinations in generative AI*  
   An investigation into what hallucinations are, why they occur, and
   which techniques (prompting, verification, constraints) reduce them.

3. *Prompting versus understanding*  
   A critical analysis of whether prompting constitutes understanding,
   delegation, or something else entirely, with concrete examples.

4. *Single-agent vs multi-agent systems*  
   A comparative study of architectural differences, benefits, risks,
   and failure modes of single-agent and multi-agent AI systems.

5. *Trust and verification in AI-assisted work*  
   An examination of how humans decide when to trust AI outputs and what
   verification strategies are effective in practice.

6. *Bias and representation in generative AI*  
   An analysis of how training data shapes model behavior and where bias
   can appear in outputs, even without explicit intent.

7. *AI as collaborator vs authority*  
   A conceptual study of different roles AI can play in human work and
   the risks of treating AI as an authority rather than a tool.

8. *Limits of generative AI in academic settings*  
   A discussion of where AI tools help learning and where they undermine
   understanding, with concrete academic examples.

9. *Data dependence and training limitations*  
   An exploration of how the scope, quality, and age of training data
   constrain what generative AI systems can reliably do.

10. *Ethical risks of delegating decisions to AI*  
    A focused analysis of the ethical and practical consequences of
    delegating judgment, responsibility, or authority to AI systems.
