* Purpose of Sprint 1

The goal of the first sprint is *project selection and framing*.

You are not building an agent yet. Instead, you will identify a real,
repeatable *human workflow* and develop a proposal for how a *single AI
agent* could assist a human user across multiple steps.

All term projects in this course must be *single-agent projects*. Your
agent may perform multiple actions (planning, checking, updating files),
but it should operate as one coherent assistant rather than as multiple
specialized agents.

The emphasis in this sprint is on *clarity, feasibility, and realism*,
not ambition.

* Sprint 1 Tasks

1. Identify one or more possible agent project topics.
2. Develop a short proposal for each topic you are considering.
3. Select the proposal that is clearest, most feasible, and easiest to
   justify.
4. Submit your proposal materials for review.

* Required Proposal Sections

Your proposal must include the following sections, using clear
headings.

** Problem Description

What are you trying to do?

Describe the human task or workflow you want to support. Explain who
performs this task, how often it occurs, and why it is time-consuming,
repetitive, error-prone, or cognitively demanding.

Focus on the *current human process*, not on the AI solution yet.

** Reason

Why is this problem interesting or important?

Explain why this problem matters to you personally and why it might
also matter to others (students, professionals, researchers,
organizations, etc.). Briefly explain why this task is a good
candidate for *agentic assistance* rather than a one-shot AI query.

** Constraints

Which difficulties do you foresee?

Discuss anticipated challenges, such as:
- technical constraints (data formats, access, reliability),
- conceptual constraints (ambiguity, judgment calls, incomplete rules),
- personal constraints (time, experience, scope).

This section should demonstrate realism rather than pessimism.

** Goals and Non-Goals

What are you going to build—and what are you explicitly *not* going to build?

List your primary goal first. If you have additional goals, list them in
order of importance. Then include a list of *non-goals*: features or
capabilities you are deliberately excluding from this project.

Non-goals are required and are a sign of good project design.

** Metrics

How will you evaluate success?

Describe how you will determine whether your project is successful.
Metrics may be quantitative or qualitative, but they must be explicit.
Examples include time saved, reduced errors, improved clarity, or
increased consistency.

** References

Which sources informed your proposal?

List all sources you used to develop the proposal. Use a consistent
citation format (e.g., AMA). Sources may include academic papers,
documentation, software tools, blog posts, videos, or personal
communication.

Each reference should be complete (author, title, date, source).

** Comments (Optional)

Any additional thoughts?

You may optionally include open concerns, unresolved questions, risks
you are unsure how to handle yet, or alternative project ideas you
considered before settling on this one.

* Submission Instructions

1. Write your proposal as a Google Docs document.
2. Include a title, your name, and the date.
3. Upload the document to a Google Drive folder named =1st Sprint Review=.
4. Ensure the folder is shared with Lyon College.
5. Submit the link to the folder in Canvas.
6. Add your name and project title to the designated Canvas page.
