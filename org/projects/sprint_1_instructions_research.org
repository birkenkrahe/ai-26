* Purpose of Sprint 1 (Option 2)

This project option is for students who want to *study and understand*
generative AI systems rather than build an agent.

In Sprint 1, your task is to frame a **research-oriented project
proposal** focused on analysis, explanation, and critical evaluation of a
generative AI topic. You are not expected to conduct the full research
yet; instead, you will define a clear question, scope, and evaluation
plan.

The goal is to demonstrate that you can:
- identify a meaningful question about generative AI,
- explain why it matters,
- scope the project realistically,
- and define what a successful outcome would look like.

* Sprint 1 Tasks

1. Select a topic related to generative AI that you want to study in
   depth.
2. Formulate a focused research question or guiding problem.
3. Write a short project proposal using the required sections below.
4. Submit your proposal materials for Sprint 1 review.

* Required Proposal Sections

Your proposal must include the following sections, using clear headings.

** Problem Description

What question are you trying to answer, or what issue are you trying to
understand?

Describe the topic you want to investigate and clearly state the central
question or problem your project will address. This should be a *how*,
*why*, or *what are the limits of* type question rather than a vague
topic description.

** Reason

Why is this problem worth studying?

Explain why this topic is interesting or important to you and why it
matters more broadly. You may connect the topic to academic work,
professional practice, ethical concerns, or societal impact.

** Constraints

What limits or difficulties do you anticipate?

Discuss constraints such as:
- access to sources or data,
- technical depth or mathematical limits,
- time and scope,
- ambiguity or disagreement in the literature.

This section should show awareness of what you *cannot* reasonably do
within the scope of the course.

** Goals and Non-Goals

What will this project produce—and what will it deliberately not attempt?

List your primary goal (for example, a structured explanatory report or
comparative analysis). If you have secondary goals, list them in order of
importance.

Then list explicit non-goals, such as:
- building software,
- proving new theorems,
- performing large-scale experiments,
- or resolving open research debates.

** Metrics

How will you judge success?

Describe how you will determine whether your project is successful.
Possible metrics include:
- clarity and coherence of explanation,
- accuracy with respect to sources,
- ability to compare competing views,
- usefulness to a non-expert reader.

Metrics may be qualitative, but they must be explicit.

** References

Which sources will inform your work?

List the sources you plan to use or have already consulted. Use a
consistent citation format (e.g. AMA). Sources may include academic
papers, books, documentation, blog posts, videos, or lectures.

Each reference should be complete (author, title, date, source).

** Comments (Optional)

Any additional thoughts?

You may include open questions, concerns about scope, alternative topics
you considered, or aspects of the project you are unsure how to approach
yet.

* Submission Instructions

1. Write your proposal as a Google Docs document.
2. Include a title, your name, and the date.
3. Upload the document to a Google Drive folder named =1st Sprint Review=.
4. Ensure the folder is shared with Lyon College.
5. Submit the link to the folder in Canvas.
6. Add your name and project title to the designated Canvas page.

* Sprint 1 Review

Sprint 1 ends with a **sprint review on February 10**.

The review will focus on:
- clarity of the research question,
- appropriateness of scope,
- feasibility within the course timeline,
- and quality of reasoning.

You are *not* evaluated on having answers yet—only on having a clear,
well-justified plan for investigating the question.
