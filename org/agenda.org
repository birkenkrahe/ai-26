* DONE Week 1 - Overview

- [X] Introduction to the lecturer
- [X] Introduction to the course

** Entry Survey Summary — What This Class Looks Like (Week 1)

*** Background & Experience
- The class has a *very mixed technical background*.
- Several students report *no prior programming experience*.
- Many have *light exposure* (Excel, one CS course, scripting, or
  tutorials).
- A small number have stronger technical backgrounds, but they are *not
  the majority*.

*Takeaway:* This course cannot assume shared technical foundations — and
it does not need to.

*** Prior Use of Generative AI
- Almost everyone has already used *ChatGPT* or a similar tool.
- Typical uses include:
  - Writing assistance
  - Homework support
  - Brainstorming ideas
  - Summarization
- Very few students have used AI for:
  - Automation
  - Multi-step workflows
  - File-based or repeatable tasks

*Takeaway:* Students are experienced *users* of AI, but not yet *designers*
of AI workflows.

*** Confidence vs. Understanding
- Many students feel AI is *useful*.
- Far fewer feel confident explaining:
  - *How* AI arrives at an answer
  - *Why* it sometimes fails
  - *When* its output should not be trusted

*Takeaway:* There is a gap between *getting answers* and *understanding
processes*.

*** Motivation for Taking the Course
- Common motivations include:
  - Wanting practical, real-world skills
  - Curiosity about AI beyond hype
  - Improving productivity and efficiency
  - Preparing for future jobs or graduate study
- Very few students cited theory or math as a primary motivation.

*Takeaway:* This group values *usefulness*, *transferable skills*, and
*hands-on work*.

*** What This Means for the Course
- We will:
  - Start from *conversation and reasoning*, not code
  - Treat AI as a *collaborator*, not an oracle
  - Focus on *workflows*, not one-off prompts
  - Expect everyone to explain what their AI system is doing
- Prior programming experience is *not required* to succeed here.

*Bottom line:* This course is about learning how to *work with* AI
responsibly and deliberately — not just how to get answers from it.

*Input:* [[file:1_overview.org][Lecture script]], [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13TC3LMOB7uT6ZouQ68MA5UbaZWGHDctJ?usp=drive_link][whiteboard screenshots]].

*ChatGPT prompt:*
#+begin_quote
"I've attached my first lecture given today. Give me 10 review
questions. For the questions don't directly link back to the
document. Short questions are better than long ones. Short answers,
too. I want to discuss these first thing in the next class. After that
I'm going to do the warm-up pair exercise that you suggested. Then
give me another 10 based on the attached whiteboard screenshots."
#+end_quote

*Output:*

1. What is the central question of this course?
   #+begin_quote
   Whether using AI means understanding a problem or just delegating
   it.
   #+end_quote

2. What is the difference between understanding and delegating?
   #+begin_quote
   Understanding allows explanation and correction; delegating does
   not.
   #+end_quote

3. Why is “vibe coding” not enough on its own?
   #+begin_quote
   Because useful output can still be unreliable or poorly understood.
   #+end_quote

4. What is the main risk of treating AI as a black box?
   #+begin_quote
   You can’t explain, verify, or fix what it produces.
   #+end_quote

5. What does “conversation before configuration” mean?
   #+begin_quote
   Using dialogue to shape behavior instead of complex setups.
   #+end_quote

6. Why does the course emphasize workflows instead of tools?
   #+begin_quote
   Tools change; reasoning and structure transfer.
   #+end_quote

7. What does it mean to say “files are memory”?
   #+begin_quote
   State and progress are stored in inspectable documents.
   #+end_quote

8. Why are failures and hallucinations treated as learning
   opportunities?
   #+begin_quote
   They reveal limits and improve verification habits.
   #+end_quote

9. Why did I describe GenAI “insanely complex”?
   #+begin_quote
   Because it combines many interacting systems beyond the model
   itself.
   #+end_quote

10. What skill matters more than prior programming experience in this
    course?
    #+begin_quote
    Curiosity and willingness to experiment.
    #+end_quote

11. What is the difference between a *workflow* and a *process*?
    #+begin_quote
    A workflow is a process that can be automated.
    #+end_quote

12. Why are agents associated with workflows rather than simple scripts?
    #+begin_quote
    Because agents act in and change an environment, not just
    respond to input.
    #+end_quote

13. Why will programmers still be needed in an AI-driven world?
    #+begin_quote
    Because someone must design, verify, and maintain reliable workflows.
    #+end_quote

14. What role does the command line (CLI) play in AI workflows?
    #+begin_quote
    It’s a universal interface for running and chaining actions.
    #+end_quote

15. Why were shell, terminal, and CLI treated as the same concept?
    #+begin_quote
    Because they all refer to a text-based way of interacting with a system.
    #+end_quote

16. Why were “Linux / macOS / Windows” crossed out together?
    #+begin_quote
    Because workflows should be independent of the operating system.
    #+end_quote

17. What does “executable (.exe)” emphasize conceptually?
    #+begin_quote
    That programs ultimately run as machine instructions.
    #+end_quote

18. Why is Python written alongside AI tools?
    #+begin_quote
    Because it’s a common glue language for workflows.
    #+end_quote

19. Why mention “Transformer (2017)” on the board?
    #+begin_quote
    To mark the architectural starting point of modern LLMs.
    #+end_quote

20. What is the core design principle behind this course?
    #+begin_quote
    To make AI behavior understandable rather than magical.
    #+end_quote

21. What is artificial intelligence trying to achieve?
    #+begin_quote
    Performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
    #+end_quote

22. What kind of problems does AI handle especially well?
    #+begin_quote
    Finding patterns in large amounts of data.
    #+end_quote

23. How does modern AI differ from rule-based programs?
    #+begin_quote
    It learns from data instead of following fixed rules.
    #+end_quote

24. What role does machine learning play in AI?
    #+begin_quote
    It allows systems to improve behavior through data.
    #+end_quote

25. Why is data central to AI systems?
    #+begin_quote
    Because models are trained and shaped by data.
    #+end_quote

26. What is a common limitation of AI?
    #+begin_quote
    Its performance depends on data quality and training.
    #+end_quote

27. Which AI area focuses on interpreting images and visual input?
    #+begin_quote
    Computer vision.
    #+end_quote

28. What does it mean that AI systems are task-specific?
    #+begin_quotenn
    They are built for particular tasks, not general intelligence.
    #+end_quote

29. Why are AI outputs often described as probabilistic?
    #+begin_quote
    They are based on likelihoods rather than fixed outcomes.
    #+end_quote

30. Why does AI require human oversight?
    #+begin_quote
    Because it is powerful but limited and can make mistakes.
    #+end_quote

The first test "Course Overview", is due on Monday, 26-January (23:59)

** DONE Warm-up exercise - "The Way of the Agent" (30 min)
#+attr_html: :width 200px :float nil:P
[[../img/the_secret_agent_conrad2.jpg]]

- You already do real workflows every week.
- An agent can *only* automate what you can specify.
- If you cannot *specify* your tasks, you cannot build/use agents.
- A task specification is akin to an *algorithmic* description.
- Find where “human common sense” (*heuristics*) sneaks in, and name it.

** DONE Discussion (Thu)

The DataCamp video ("What can AI do?") from chapter 1 states:
#+begin_quote
»AI is only as good as the data it learns from.«
#+end_quote

In IT, this is also called "Garbage in, garbage out." (GIGO)

Discuss:
1) Do you think this is true?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, but it's incomplete: Bad data sets the limits of what an AI
   can reliably learn; good data does not guarantee good behavior.
   #+end_quote
2) Can you find an example for 'bad data' leading to 'bad AI'?
   #+begin_quote
   - Facial recognition systems respond directly to training data
     based on skin color - e.g. cannot see X-skinned people.
   - Medical AI trained on data from one population failing on
     another. Skin cancer recognition depending on skin color.
   - Hiring systems encode discrimination when based on certain data.
   #+end_quote
3) Is this true for humans?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes, and no. Humans also learn from examples, experiences,
   feedback. "Bad data" correspond to: lack of information, biased
   feedback. But humans can reflect on their data and question
   it. They can also use bad data to develop resilience to it
   (e.g. click bait, email scams, fake news).
   #+end_quote
4) Can you find a counterexample ('bad data' leading to 'good AI')?
5) Can you find a counterexample for human decisions?

#+begin_notes
- 'Bad' data are: noisy, missing, or incorrect.
- 'Good AI' is AI that makes predictions with high accuracy.
- Example for 4): AI "toxicity training" ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04741][Li et al, 2025]])
- Examples for 5): Scientific serendipity (failed experiments leading
  to good scientific results): Discovery of penicillin by accident
  through Fleming in 1928; Vicarious learning or "crash test" effect:
  humans can learn from other people's bad data without experiencing
  it themselves.

    While AI coding assistance can speed up some tasks, it can
    undermine the development of coding skills and deep understanding

    #+begin_quote Key message of this summary
    The key message is that AI agents should be treated less like
    fragile tools and more like junior collaborators—given high-level
    goals, room to explore, and safe failure modes—because real
    productivity and innovation come from delegating outcomes rather
    than micromanaging tasks, even if that means “running dangerously”
    and adapting workflows, culture, and management practices
    accordingly.

** Personalize your ChatGPT I + II

Class exercise - 15 min

*** Part I - for the self-assessment exercise
- Open the ChatGPT dashboard.
- Open the settings (bottom left).
- Open the =Personalization= menu.
- Set it to the following values:
  1. *Base style and tone*: Efficient
  2. *Warm*: Less
  3. *Enthusiastic*: Less
  4. *Headers & Lists*: Default
  5. *Emoji*: Less
  6. *About me:*
     #+begin_example
     I am a student in DSC 482: Coding in an AI World.
     I am learning to use AI as a collaborator and agent, not as an oracle.
     I am a beginner with no/little/intermediate programming experience.
     I am expected to understand, explain, and verify AI outputs.
     When I ask for help, I want explanations I can defend and modify.
     #+end_example
  7. *About me*: Add some facts about yourself (only what you're willing
     to share on a resume).

*** Test personalization I

In a new chat, ask a deliberately vague question:
#+begin_quote
"Help me automate my weekly study routine."
#+end_quote

*Rename* the chat: =Test persona (default)=.

*** Instructions for all your class work

Copy the instructions from [[https://tinyurl.com/chatgpt-personalization][tinyurl.com/chatgpt-personalization]] into
the =Custom instructions= field of your ChatGPT dashboard.

In a *new chat*, ask the same vague question again.

*Rename* the chat: =Test persona (custom)=.

*Share* an observation about the difference between the two.

*** Test personalization (my results)

**** My default test persona:

Your request is underspecified. “Automate” can mean several different
things in this context. To proceed correctly, the following
clarification is required:

Specify what kind of automation you want, for example:

- Scheduling (calendar reminders, recurring tasks)
- Study plan generation (weekly topics, time blocks)
- Workflow automation (scripts, Makefiles, Org-mode, cron jobs)
- Progress tracking (checklists, logs, reports)
- Tool integration (Emacs/Org-mode, shell scripts, Git, Anki, etc.)

Also specify:

- The subject(s) you are studying
- The time horizon (e.g., weekly, semester-long)
- The tools you already use (e.g. plain text, calendar apps)

Once these are defined, an automatable routine can be designed
precisely rather than generically.

**** My custom test persona:

***** Automating a Weekly Study Routine — Structured Breakdown

****** 1. Clarify the goal
To automate a routine, the routine must be explicit first.

Possible interpretations of *automation* (one or more may apply):

- Scheduling: automatically generate a weekly study schedule
- Tracking: automatically record what was studied and for how long
- Enforcement: reminders, deadlines, or checklists
- Documentation: automatic notes, logs, or summaries
- Feedback: progress checks, spaced repetition, review prompts

Missing information:
- Which of these should be automated
- Which parts should remain manual

---

****** 2. Define the inputs (required each week)

Please specify or confirm:

- Subjects or projects being studied
- Total time budget per week
- Preferred session length (e.g., 30 / 50 / 90 minutes)
- Fixed constraints (teaching days, meetings, deadlines)
- Tools already used or preferred
  (e.g., Org-mode, calendar, shell scripts, cron, reminders)

If any of these vary week to week, that variability must be stated.

---

****** 3. Define the outputs (what automation produces)

Examples of concrete outputs:

- Weekly plan (plain text, Org-mode, calendar events)
- Daily task list
- Study log entries
- Review questions or checkpoints
- Explicit done / not-done signals

Automation requires outputs that are concrete and checkable.

---

****** 4. Make assumptions explicit

Unless stated otherwise, the following assumptions would be made:

- The routine is meant to be repeatable week-to-week
- Text-based, scriptable tooling is preferred
- Low overhead is desired (no complex app)

If any assumption is wrong, it affects the design.

---

****** 5. Draft minimal automation pipeline (placeholder)

This is a structural sketch, not an implementation:

1. Weekly input file
   - Topics + time budget
2. Expansion step
   - Daily study blocks
   - Explicit tasks per block
3. End-of-session logging
   - Planned vs. completed
4. Weekly review
   - Carryover + adjustments

Implementation should only happen after inputs and outputs are fixed.

---

****** 6. Verification checks

Any automated routine should answer:

- Was the routine actually followed?
- Did it reduce decision-making overhead?
- Did it reflect reality rather than idealized plans?

If these cannot be checked, automation will fail silently.

---

****** 7. Required next step

Please answer at least the following:

1. What exactly do you want automated
   (schedule, tracking, reminders, notes)?
2. What tool or format must the output be in?
3. What part of your current weekly study routine causes the most friction?

Once these are clear, a concrete, repeatable workflow can be designed.

** Term project: Instructions, ideas, examples
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/sprint_1.png]]

- Two options: Build your own single *agent*, or research an AI *topic*.

- Purpose is *not* to deliver a complete product but to *learn* as you go.

- Sprint 1 (Feb 1, 2.30 pm): Develop a structured project proposal.

- *To do:*
  1) Look at the shared documents in my GDrive folder:
     [[https://tinyurl.com/agent-project][tinyurl.com/agent-project]] - instruction, example, ideas
  2) Enter your name and project title in =Canvas > Pages > Projects=
     table.
  3) Begin working on your proposal and share your prototype(s) freely
     with me.
  4) It's good to try out several proposals before settling on one.

- Must understand the difference between *cognitive* and *true* agents.

- Feel free to use AI to help you: *But you will present it yourself.*

- For the proposal presentation, you can use slides.

- If you use NotebookLM to create a slide deck, use the *Short* option.

** PRACTICE Project design with NotebookLM

See here for the full exercise: [[https://tinyurl.com/sprint1-notebooklm][tinyurl.com/sprint1-notebooklm]]

* Week 5 - Prompting techniques / Designing a game / Project proposal presentations

- [ ] *Practice*: Developing a simple game with ChatGPT.
- [ ] *Presentation*: Your project proposals (be prepared).
- [ ] *Review*: DataCamp "Prompting unveiled".

** NEXT Presentation of your project proposals (1st sprint review)

*What I'm going to ask:*
1) What's the purpose of your project?
2) What is the main deliverable of your project?
3) What is your greatest challenge for this project?
4) What are you going to do in the next sprint?

Enhanced exercise (see Canvas):
- *Create a prompt with ChatGPT using your proposal (draft) as source.*
- *Use NotebookLM to create a short slide deck to present your project.*

** PRACTICE Building a simple game with AI
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/game2.png]]

Apply the prompting techniques you learnt to build an app in no more
than 30 minutes, including at least 1 improvement loop and testing.

Remember the process we applied for our birthday generator app:

1. *Goal* (what kind of game?)
2. *Inputs* (what does the player do?)
3. *Output* (how do you know it worked?)
4. One *improvement* you plan to add

*Examples:* You could build
- A reaction game (timing matters)
- A guessing game (the system checks how close they are)
- A rules based game (player input is scored)
- A text-based game (choices lead to outcomes)

** Vote on the best game

Criteria:
1) *Clarity*: Can you tell what it is supposed to do in < 10 sec
2) *Functionality*: Does it actually work when played?
3) *Iteration*: Is there at least one visible improvement beyond the
   first version?

** TODO Submit your game design in Canvas (share conversation)

** DataCamp Review: Prompting unveiled

* Week 6 - Connecting Apps / Creating GPT agents
