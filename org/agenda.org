* Week 1 - Overview

- [X] Introduction to the lecturer
- [X] Introduction to the course
  
** Entry Survey Summary — What This Class Looks Like (Week 1)

*** Background & Experience
- The class has a *very mixed technical background*.
- Several students report *no prior programming experience*.
- Many have *light exposure* (Excel, one CS course, scripting, or
  tutorials).
- A small number have stronger technical backgrounds, but they are *not
  the majority*.

*Takeaway:* This course cannot assume shared technical foundations — and
it does not need to.

*** Prior Use of Generative AI
- Almost everyone has already used *ChatGPT* or a similar tool.
- Typical uses include:
  - Writing assistance
  - Homework support
  - Brainstorming ideas
  - Summarization
- Very few students have used AI for:
  - Automation
  - Multi-step workflows
  - File-based or repeatable tasks

*Takeaway:* Students are experienced *users* of AI, but not yet *designers*
of AI workflows.

*** Confidence vs. Understanding
- Many students feel AI is *useful*.
- Far fewer feel confident explaining:
  - *How* AI arrives at an answer
  - *Why* it sometimes fails
  - *When* its output should not be trusted

*Takeaway:* There is a gap between *getting answers* and *understanding
processes*.

*** Motivation for Taking the Course
- Common motivations include:
  - Wanting practical, real-world skills
  - Curiosity about AI beyond hype
  - Improving productivity and efficiency
  - Preparing for future jobs or graduate study
- Very few students cited theory or math as a primary motivation.

*Takeaway:* This group values *usefulness*, *transferable skills*, and
*hands-on work*.

*** What This Means for the Course
- We will:
  - Start from *conversation and reasoning*, not code
  - Treat AI as a *collaborator*, not an oracle
  - Focus on *workflows*, not one-off prompts
  - Expect everyone to explain what their AI system is doing
- Prior programming experience is *not required* to succeed here.

*Bottom line:* This course is about learning how to *work with* AI
 responsibly and deliberately — not just how to get answers from it.

*Input:* [[file:1_overview.org][Lecture script]], [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13TC3LMOB7uT6ZouQ68MA5UbaZWGHDctJ?usp=drive_link][whiteboard screenshots]].

*ChatGPT prompt:*
#+begin_quote
"I've attached my first lecture given today. Give me 10 review
questions. For the questions don't directly link back to the
document. Short questions are better than long ones. Short answers,
too. I want to discuss these first thing in the next class. After that
I'm going to do the warm-up pair exercise that you suggested. Then
give me another 10 based on the attached whiteboard screenshots."
#+end_quote

*Output:*

1. What is the central question of this course?
   #+begin_quote
   Whether using AI means understanding a problem or just delegating
   it.
   #+end_quote

2. What is the difference between understanding and delegating?
   #+begin_quote
   Understanding allows explanation and correction; delegating does
   not.
   #+end_quote

3. Why is “vibe coding” not enough on its own?
   #+begin_quote
   Because useful output can still be unreliable or poorly understood.
   #+end_quote

4. What is the main risk of treating AI as a black box?
   #+begin_quote
   You can’t explain, verify, or fix what it produces.
   #+end_quote

5. What does “conversation before configuration” mean?
   #+begin_quote
   Using dialogue to shape behavior instead of complex setups.
   #+end_quote

6. Why does the course emphasize workflows instead of tools?
   #+begin_quote
   Tools change; reasoning and structure transfer.
   #+end_quote

7. What does it mean to say “files are memory”?
   #+begin_quote
   State and progress are stored in inspectable documents.
   #+end_quote

8. Why are failures and hallucinations treated as learning
   opportunities?
   #+begin_quote
   They reveal limits and improve verification habits.
   #+end_quote

9. Why did I describe GenAI “insanely complex”?
   #+begin_quote
   Because it combines many interacting systems beyond the model
   itself.
   #+end_quote

10. What skill matters more than prior programming experience in this
    course?
    #+begin_quote
    Curiosity and willingness to experiment.
    #+end_quote

11. What is the difference between a *workflow* and a *process*?
    #+begin_quote
    A workflow is a process that can be automated.
    #+end_quote

12. Why are agents associated with workflows rather than simple scripts?
    #+begin_quote
    Because agents act in and change an environment, not just
    respond to input.
    #+end_quote

13. Why will programmers still be needed in an AI-driven world?
    #+begin_quote
    Because someone must design, verify, and maintain reliable workflows.
    #+end_quote

14. What role does the command line (CLI) play in AI workflows?
    #+begin_quote
    It’s a universal interface for running and chaining actions.
    #+end_quote

15. Why were shell, terminal, and CLI treated as the same concept?
    #+begin_quote
    Because they all refer to a text-based way of interacting with a system.
    #+end_quote

16. Why were “Linux / macOS / Windows” crossed out together?
    #+begin_quote
    Because workflows should be independent of the operating system.
    #+end_quote

17. What does “executable (.exe)” emphasize conceptually?
    #+begin_quote
    That programs ultimately run as machine instructions.
    #+end_quote

18. Why is Python written alongside AI tools?
    #+begin_quote
    Because it’s a common glue language for workflows.
    #+end_quote

19. Why mention “Transformer (2017)” on the board?
    #+begin_quote
    To mark the architectural starting point of modern LLMs.
    #+end_quote

20. What is the core design principle behind this course?
    #+begin_quote
    To make AI behavior understandable rather than magical.
    #+end_quote

21. What is artificial intelligence trying to achieve?
    #+begin_quote
    Performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
    #+end_quote

22. What kind of problems does AI handle especially well?
    #+begin_quote
    Finding patterns in large amounts of data.
    #+end_quote

23. How does modern AI differ from rule-based programs?
    #+begin_quote
    It learns from data instead of following fixed rules.
    #+end_quote

24. What role does machine learning play in AI?
    #+begin_quote
    It allows systems to improve behavior through data.
    #+end_quote

25. Why is data central to AI systems?
    #+begin_quote
    Because models are trained and shaped by data.
    #+end_quote

26. What is a common limitation of AI?
    #+begin_quote
    Its performance depends on data quality and training.
    #+end_quote

27. Which AI area focuses on interpreting images and visual input?
    #+begin_quote
    Computer vision.
    #+end_quote

28. What does it mean that AI systems are task-specific?
    #+begin_quotenn
    They are built for particular tasks, not general intelligence.
    #+end_quote

29. Why are AI outputs often described as probabilistic?
    #+begin_quote
    They are based on likelihoods rather than fixed outcomes.
    #+end_quote

30. Why does AI require human oversight?
    #+begin_quote
    Because it is powerful but limited and can make mistakes.
    #+end_quote

The first test "Course Overview", is due on Monday, 26-January (23:59)

* DONE Warm-up exercise - "The Way of the Agent" (30 min)
#+attr_html: :width 200px :float nil:P
[[../img/the_secret_agent_conrad2.jpg]]

- You already do real workflows every week.
- An agent can *only* automate what you can specify.
- If you cannot *specify* your tasks, you cannot build/use agents.
- A task specification is akin to an *algorithmic* description.
- Find where “human common sense” (*heuristics*) sneaks in, and name it.

* TODO Discussion (Thu)

The DataCamp video ("What can AI do?") from chapter 1 states:
#+begin_quote
»AI is only as good as the data it learns from.«
#+end_quote

In IT, this is also called "Garbage in, garbage out." (GIGO)

Discuss:
1) Do you think this is true?
2) Can you find an example for 'bad data' leading to 'bad AI'?
3) Is this true for humans?
4) Can you find a counterexample ('bad data' leading to 'good AI')?
5) Can you find a counterexample for human decisions?

#+begin_notes
- 'Bad' data are: noisy, missing, or incorrect.
- 'Good AI' is AI that makes predictions with high accuracy.
- Example for 4): AI "toxicity training" ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04741][Li et al, 2025]])
- Examples for 5): Scientific serendipity (failed experiments leading
  to good scientific results): Discovery of penicillin by accident
  through Fleming in 1928; Vicarious learning or "crash test" effect:
  humans can learn from other people's bad data without experiencing
  it themselves.

- Purpose is *not* to deliver a complete product but to *learn* as you go.
- Sprint 1 (Feb 9): Develop a structured project proposal.
- TODO:
  1) Look at the shared documents in my GDrive folder:
     [[https://tinyurl.com/agent-project][tinyurl.com/agent-project]] - instruction, example, ideas
  2) Enter your name and project title in =Canvas > Pages > Projects=
     table.
  3) Begin working on your proposal and share your prototype(s) freely
     with me.
  4) It's good to try out several proposals before settling on one.
