* Objectives
* Cognitive vs. true agents

- There are two *kinds of agents*, cognitive vs. true agent.
  
- Both types reason in similar ways; the difference is *what they are
  allowed to do*.
  
- *Cognitive agents* produce advice and structure but do not change the
  world. This can be done purely through conversation (no coding).
  
- *True agents* can change their environment by using tools, which
  introduces risk and responsibility. Also: much more IT.
  
- The key question shifts from *correctness* to *permission and trust*.

| Dimension        | Cognitive Agent        | True Agent (Env-Changing) |
|------------------+------------------------+---------------------------|
| Core ability     | Reasoning only         | Reasoning + actions       |
| Primary role     | Advisor / reviewer     | Acting assistant          |
| Inputs           | Text in prompt         | Files in workspace        |
| Outputs          | Text responses         | Text + files              |
| State            | Conceptual / implicit  | External / persistent     |
| Persistence      | Ends with session      | Survives across runs      |
| Env interaction  | None                   | Read/write (limited)      |
| Typical actions  | Summarize, plan, check | Update, track, generate   |
| Failure mode     | Wrong or vague text    | Harmful side effects      |
| Risk level       | Low                    | Higher                    |
| Guardrails       | Prompt clarity         | Permissions + logging     |
| Human role       | Decision-maker         | Supervisor                |
| Course example   | Audit summary          | Writes audit.md           |
| Trust question   | “Is this sound?”       | “Should it do this?”     |

* Term project: Instructions, ideas, examples (Thu)
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/sprint_1.png]]

- Two options: Build your own single *agent*, or research an AI *topic*.
- Purpose is *not* to deliver a complete product but to *learn* as you go.
- Sprint 1 (Feb 9): Develop a structured project proposal.
- TODO:
  1) Look at the shared documents in my GDrive folder:
     [[https://tinyurl.com/agent-project][tinyurl.com/agent-project]] - instruction, example, ideas
  2) Enter your name and project title in =Canvas > Pages > Projects=
     table.
  3) Begin working on your proposal and share your prototype(s) freely
     with me.
  4) It's good to try out several proposals before settling on one.

* My personal precious project: Advising Multi-Agent

Purpose: To build an AI agent that prepares degree audits and schedule
simulations for academic advising, reducing repetitive checking while
keeping all decisions and approvals with the human advisor.
