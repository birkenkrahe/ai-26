#+STARTUP: overview hideblocks indent entitiespretty: 
* In-class micro-exercise: From Prompt → Spec → Web App (15–20 min)

** Setup (1 min)
You will work in pairs. Your job is to:
1) identify the elements (Goal/Input/Output/Layout/Features) in short
   “messy” user requests,
2) rewrite them as a clean spec using the exact 5-line template,
3) turn ONE spec into a tiny web app plan (and optionally start coding if time).

** Part A: Identify the elements (5 min)
Below are 4 short user requests. For each request:
- underline or label the parts that correspond to: Goal, Input,
  Output, Layout, Features
- if an element is missing, write *MISSING* next to it.

*** Request A
"I want a page that helps me pick a movie for tonight. I tell it my
mood and how much time I have. It should suggest 3 movies. Put the
suggestions in big cards and let me click one to see a short pitch."

*** Request B
"Make something to help me track my workouts. I enter exercise name,
sets, reps, and weight. It should show a weekly summary and highlight
personal records. Keep the form on the left and the charts on the
right."

*** Request C
"I need a tiny tool to write better subject lines for emails. I paste
my draft subject line and tell you the tone (formal/friendly). Return
5 improved options. Add a button to copy each one."

*** Request D
"Build a simple quiz page for my class. Students choose a topic and
difficulty. The page generates 5 multiple-choice questions and shows
the score at the end. Make it phone-friendly and add a ‘Try again’
button."

** Part B: Turn one request into a 5-line spec (5 min)
Pick ONE of A–D and rewrite it using this exact template:

1) *Goal*:
2) *Input*:
3) *Output*:
4) *Layout*:
5) *Features*:

Rules:
- Each line must be one sentence.
- Inputs must be listed as fields (what the user types/chooses).
- Output must be testable (“I can tell if it worked”).
- Layout describes where things appear (left/right/top/bottom).
- Features are behaviors beyond the core input→output (history, copy,
  remove, save, etc.).

** Part C: Convert the spec into a web app plan (5 min)
Using your rewritten spec, produce a short plan with 4 bullets:

- *UI components*: list the visible parts (form fields, buttons, panels,
  card area)
- *State*: list what variables the page must remember (e.g., messages[],
  currentInput)
- *Functions*: list 3–5 functions (e.g., generateMessage(),
  addToStack(), copyCard())
- *Events*: list what triggers what (button clicks, Enter key, remove
  card)

Deliverable: write this plan in your notes as if you were about to
code it.

** Optional (if time): Start implementing (5–10 min)
Create a single-file HTML app with:
- the inputs on the left,
- the output area on the right,
- one working button that produces an output.
You do NOT need perfect styling—just make the behavior work.

** Quick share-out (2 min)
Each pair shares:
- one ambiguity you found (what you had to decide),
- one feature you added that wasn’t explicit (and why),
- one test you would use to verify the app works.

* Instructor wrap (30 seconds)
Notice the pattern:
- A good prompt contains a spec.
- A good spec becomes UI + state + functions + events.
- Most “agentic” work is really: turning vague language into testable
  structure.
