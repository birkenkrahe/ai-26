* Agent Journal Entry — 2026-01-08 — Establishing an Agent Journal Workflow :export:
** Context

I am preparing an instructor-led case study for a course on Coding
with AI (agentic AI). The goal is to make my own agentic workflow
visible to students, while keeping a clear separation between private
reasoning and public artifacts.

In particular, I want to continue writing freely in Emacs using
Org-mode, while publishing selected, curated entries to the course
repository as an "agent journal" that documents decisions, failures,
and judgments rather than polished results.

** Agent Setup

At this stage there is no autonomous agent.

The workflow consists of:
- a private administrative repository containing my working journal
- Emacs Org-mode as the primary writing environment
- a Python script that extracts export-tagged Org subtrees
- manual copying of exported entries into the public course repository

The use of tags (e.g. ~:export:~) marks the boundary between private
reasoning and material intended for students.

** What Happened

I created an ~org/agent-journal/~ directory in the public course
repository and committed it as the destination for curated journal
entries. I also created a private ~journal.org~ file in my
administrative repository to serve as the canonical source of truth.

After considering alternatives (such as direct publication or
automated synchronization), I decided to keep a manual copy step
between repositories.  This preserves a deliberate pause for review
before anything becomes public.

** Judgment

Maintaining a hard boundary between private work and published
artifacts aligns with the central theme of the course: agentic AI
systems should assist human work, not bypass human judgment.

The manual publishing step introduces intentional friction, which is
desirable at this stage. It reinforces the idea that agents and
automation operate under explicit supervision and that responsibility
for what is published remains with the human.
