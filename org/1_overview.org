* Hook: New Tools, Old Problems

Source: [[https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/claude-code-and-what-comes-next][Claude Code and What Comes Next]] by Ethan Mollick, 7-Jan-2026.

** The Problem - Making money

#+begin_quote
“Develop a web-based or software-based startup idea that will make me
$1000 a month where you do all the work by generating the idea and
implementing it. I shouldn’t have to do anything at all except run
some program you give me once. it shouldn’t require any coding
knowledge on my part, so make sure everything works well.”
#+end_quote

** The Solution - Vibe coded website

#+begin_quote
"The AI asked me three multiple choice questions and decided that I
should be selling sets of 500 prompts for professional users for
$39. Without any further input, it then worked independently… FOR AN
HOUR AND FOURTEEN MINUTES creating hundreds of code files and
prompts. And then it gave me a single file to run that created and
deployed a working website (filled with very sketchy fake marketing
claims) that sold the promised 500 prompt set. You can actually see
the site it launched here, though I removed the sales link, which did
actually work and would have collected money. I strongly suspect that
if I ignored my conscience and actually sold these prompt packs, I
would make the promised $1,000."
#+end_quote

** The New Problem - You can't vibe all the way to the money

#+begin_quote
"Unfortunately for most of us who want to experiment with AI, these
new tools are built for programmers. And I mean they are really built
for programmers: they assume that you understand Python commands and
programming best practices and they are wrapped in interfaces that
look like something from a 1980s computer lab. They are also
explicitly designed to help analyze, troubleshoot, and write code
using approaches that fit into existing programmer workflows."
#+end_quote

** What to do - Begin by changing your approach to tasks

#+begin_quote
"What does all this mean? If you're a programmer, you should already
be exploring these tools. If you're programming-adjacent (an academic
who works with data, a designer who wants to experiment with code,
anyone who wants to try building a thing they are imagining) this is
your moment to experiment. But there's a deeper point here: with the
right harness, today's AIs are capable of real, sustained work that
actually matters, and that, in turn, is starting to change how we
approach tasks."
#+end_quote

* How complicated is this technology really? Python isn't hard!

This diagram below describes the encoder, a foundational piece of the
LLM architecture, and still only 5% of the total stack.

What people call GenAI includes:
- Tokenization
- Embeddings
- Attention blocks
- Decoding
- Sampling strategies
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Tool calling
- Memory
- Guardrails
- User interface
- Retrieval Augmented Memory (RAG)
- Infrastructure

This is an insanely complex technology that few people understand from
top to bottom, and even fewer are able to work with it professionally.

A typical journal paper title therefore looks like this:

* How This Course Was Designed

1. *Beginner-friendly by design*: No prior programming experience is
   required. Curiosity and willingness to experiment matter more than
   technical background.

2. *Conversation before configuration*: You will work with AI systems
   primarily through dialogue—explaining goals, refining instructions,
   and iterating—rather than setting up complex tools or platforms.

3. *Agents must be understandable*: You are expected to explain what
   your AI agent does, why it does it, and where it can
   fail. Black-box behavior is not sufficient.

4. *Files are memory*: Plain-text files (such as notes, CSVs, logs, and
   PDFs) act as shared state and checkpoints so workflows can be
   inspected and verified.

5. *Visualize your workflow*: You will use simple diagrams (Mermaid) to
   map agent workflows. The diagrams describe your reasoning and are
   portable across tools.

6. *Failure is part of learning*: Mistakes, hallucinations, and
   breakdowns are expected and analyzed, not hidden or penalized.

7. *Low cost, transferable skills*: All required tools are free or
   provided for the course. The focus is on skills that transfer
   beyond any single AI platform.

8. *One capstone, built iteratively*: Throughout the term, you will
   develop a single capstone project using short, Scrum-style sprints,
   with regular sprint reviews leading up to the final presentation.

* What we're going to do (flexible)
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/title_slide.png]]

- See [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4KI-sMSBOe3sug87lyfwhczaDGtk4-5/view?usp=sharing][presentation]] based only on the syllabus ([[https://notebooklm.google.com][notebooklm.google.com]]).
- Schedule is likely to change (ups and downs).
- Platforms are likely to change.
- Grading and deliverables are not going to change.

* Understanding vs. delegating

I gave this question from my presentaiton to four models:
#+begin_quote
If an AI gives you a useful result, but you don't understand how it
got there, did you actually solve the problem?
#+end_quote


These are excerpts from their answers:
- [[../img/chatgpt_answer.png][ChatGPT's answer]] 
- [[../img/gemini_answer.png][Gemini's answer]]
- [[../img/claude_answer.png][Claude's answer]]
- [[../img/grok_answer.png][Grok's answer]]

* Which AI tools we will work with (probably)

- *ChatGPT* because we have it at Lyon (you've been added to the Team).
- *NotebookLM* (already used) & you should create your own notebook.
- *Codex* in *ChatGPT* and *GPTs*.
- *Gemini* because we have Pro (at Lyon) with *Gems*.
- *opencode.ai* because I just discovered it and like it.
- *Replit.com* (perhaps) because it's pricy and has lock-in.
- *Lovable* (because) it was recommended.
- *Claude* (perhaps) if I can get my head around it.
- *Notion* (perhaps) agent specific.
- *n8n* (perhaps) as a graphic agent-design tool.

* Where to find stuff (for certain)

- The links to these locations are in =Canvas > Pages > Course links=
- You can find all tests, assignments, grades, recordings on *Canvas*.
- You can find all lectures, assignments, PDFs on *GitHub*.
- You can share insights, comments, questions on *Google Chat*.
- You must upload your project files to *GDrive*.

* What you have to do next

- Register with DataCamp using your lyon.edu account.
- Go to Canvas > Pages > Course links and activate the invitation.
- Let's take a look at DataCamp together.
- Complete these on a weekly basis. 

* Next assignment - DataCamp
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/datacamp.png]]

- We're working with the online learning platform DataCamp.
- As a course participant, you have free access to all courses.
- There are several courses on offer, we'll only certainly do the
  first two:
  1) [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-artificial-intelligence][Understanding Artificial Intelligence]] (foundational)
  2) [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-chatgpt][Understanding ChatGPT]] (very short)
  3) [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/practical-ai-with-google-gemini-and-notebooklm][Practical AI with Google Gemini and NotebookLM]] (useful)
  4) [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-prompt-engineering][Understanding Prompt Engineering]] (maybe)
  5) [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/vibe-coding-with-replit?cf-exp=comm--ai-native-cdp-layout%3Aon][Vibe Coding with Replit]] (probably not)

- Completing these short courses will increase your AI literacy
- Many examples will show you many different AI use cases
- You can share your certificate of completion on LinkedIn

* First assignment

- Complete the first chapter of "[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-artificial-intelligence][Understanding AI]]" by next *Tuesday*.
- Complete the second chapter by next *Thursday*.
- Think about a *workflow* that you would like to automate.
- Think about a *project* (perhaps related to it) to pursue.

* Warm-up exercise (too easy? Think again)

- Pick one task you personally do at least once a week.
- Pair up and explain the task to each other.
- Whoever listens may only ask clarifying questions.
- Switch roles after a while.

Questions:
#+begin_quote
1. At what point did the explanation break down?
2. What did you assume the other person already knew?
3. Would an AI have made the same assumptions?
